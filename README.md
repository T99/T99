# Hi! I'm Trevor.

← That's me over there (not the blonde)!

I'm a full-stack developer hailing from the Cherry Capital of the world, Traverse City, Michigan, where I'm currently employed as a web developer for a local
marketing firm, Knorr Marketing.

Outside of work, I spend time working on my side projects and mentoring local FRC team 1711 - 'The Raptors' (a highschool robotics team full of awesome people).
